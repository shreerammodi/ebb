## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Bulk-add sheets from the ribbon and the command palette.
- Enumerate default sheet names per-side.

### Changed

- Group the keybindings in `config.toml` into nested `[keymap.*]` tables
  instead of quoted dotted keys. Files from earlier versions are still read
  and migrate to the new layout on the next settings change.
- Make the empty-state Judge a peer button inline with Aff/Neg.

### Fixed

- Create and source `config.toml` on launch even when no flow is open, so a
  fresh install no longer skips it until the first flow is opened.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed

- Hoist the update provider so the Updates settings tab can't crash.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- Export through the native Save As picker instead of a forced download.
- Ship the full default keymap and every configurable command in
  `config.toml`.

### Changed

- Split the in-app guide into a keyboard-shortcut sheet plus external docs.
- Build a single macOS universal binary.

### Fixed

- Stop the Close tooltip from auto-popping when a dialog opens.
- Show Cmd+Arrows for jump-to-edge on Mac in the guide.
- Right-align menu chord hints against a shared column.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- Ad-hoc sign macOS builds and document the Gatekeeper quarantine bypass.
- Ship AppImage only on Linux; drop Flatpak distribution.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-07
